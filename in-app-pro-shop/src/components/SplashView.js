            <h3>
                Add in-app purchases without having to build a system from scratch.
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Quickly create a Shop, defining and categorizing the items you will sell.</li>

                <li>Interact with the In-App Pro Shop smart contracts to allow users to purchase Items.</li>

                <li>Set prices in a stable fiat currency, get paid in Ether.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Items are minted as <a href="http://erc721.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ERC-721 non-fungible tokens</a>, which users can trade, sell, or rent on the open market.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building your Shop is free, except for the gas price associated with each blockchain transaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                A small percentage (3%) of each sale goes to the franchise owner (<a href="http://futurescale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Futurescale, Inc.</a>),
                and the rest is immediately available for withdrawal by the Shop Owner.
